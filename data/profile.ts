  bio: `
    I am a machine learning researcher and a life-long engineer. I love building things—pushing the frontier of AI to make it more useful, safe, and available to everyone.

    My recent research spans scalable agent architectures, context management, LLM post-training, and evaluation. I am most excited about research that has direct product impact.
